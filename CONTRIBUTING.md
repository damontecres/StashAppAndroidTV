## Tips

### Submodule

Certain assets are provided by the Stash repo (https://github.com/stashapp/stash) which is included as a submodule. Make sure to run `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote` after cloning this repo to get the latest version of the submodule.

If you get compile errors such as `java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: .../StashAppAndroidTV/app/src/main/res/mipmap-nodpi/stash_logo.png`, you need to update the submodule (or the paths in `stashapp/stash` have changed!).

### Development

See [Development](DEVELOPMENT.md) for more information on the app's architecture.
